    DOMjudge offers a Slack workspace where developers and users can chat about
    any questions, comments, ideas and other DOMjudge related things they want.
</p>
<p>
    Our workspace can be found at
    <a href="https://domjudge-org.slack.com/" target="_blank">https://domjudge-org.slack.com/</a>.
    To join as a new member, you can use
    <a href="/slack/join" target="_blank">this page to sign up</a>.

<p>
    Once you have joined the Slack workspace, feel free to ask any DOMjudge-related
    questions you might have.Â Please do note that it may sometimes take a bit longer
    than a few minutes to get a response, partly because people might be in different timezones.
