<h2>API documentation</h2>

<p>DOMjudge provides a JSON REST API that can be used to query contest
state as well as perform certain actions, such as submit solutions
(with team role), request to judge submissions (with judgehost role),
and control contest state (with admin role).</p>

<p>The DOMjudge API is an implementation of the ICPC
<a href="https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/master/contest_api">Contest API</a>
(except that it does not (yet) implement the optional <code>team-members</code>
endpoint). It also has some extensions, see the
<a href="demoweb/api/doc">internal API documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Wiki</h2>

<p>We also have the
<a href="https://github.com/DOMjudge/domjudge/wiki">DOMjudge wiki</a>
which collects other pieces of information about specific configurations
or integrations.</p>
