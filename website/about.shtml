<p>DOMjudge is an automated judge system to run programming contests. It
has a mechanism to submit problem solutions, have them judged fully
automatically and provides (web)interfaces for teams, the jury and the
general public.</p>

<p>DOMjudge is primarily focused to be used in programming contests like the
<a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/">ICPC</a> programming contests,
where teams are on-site and there is a fixed problem set and time frame.
It can however also be adapted to other contexts.
</p>

<p>The system scales well: distributed judging is easy and it has a
modular system for plugging in languages or compilers. The team interface
is kept simple and efficient, while the administrator's view has many
features, including rejudging, clarifications, detailed submission/judging
information. There's a REST API to extend DOMjudge in any direction you need.
</p>

<p>It is free and open source software, making it easy to adapt it to your
needs.</p>
