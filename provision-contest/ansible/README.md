# Ansible code for DOMjudge at the ICPC World Finals

The ansible code under this directory is used to configure running
DOMjudge at the ICPC World Finals, both as primary and shadow CCS.
This ansible code can deploy four different types of machines:

* admin: used by DOMjudge staff to work on and access the other
  machines from. Also has a local DOMjudge install with domserver and
  judgedaemon, running in DEV mode.
* domserver: machines running the DOMjudge web server and
  MySQL/MariaDB database. By default we have two: a primary and a
  backup.
* judgehost: machines running one judgedaemon each. We use as many as
  necessary and depending on machines available. These should be
  identical to each other and preferably also to the team machines.
* grafana: TODO

## Code organization

The ansible tasks are split up in
[roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)
to prevent duplication.

Global and group variables are stored under `group_vars`. The file
`group_vars/all/secret.yml.example` should be copied to
`group_vars/all/secret.yml` and then all variables should be set
and/or modified as required.

There are a few places where additional files should/can be added:
* SSH public/private keys under `roles/ssh/files/`.
* SSL certificates and keys under `roles/ssl/files/`.
* Machine/group specific local packages under `roles/base_packages/files/install-*/`.
* Judgehost chroot local packages under `roles/judgedaemon/files/install-chroot/`.

## TODO

* Adding entries to `/etc/hosts` from the local inventory is messy and
  the current tasks keep reporting as "changed" after each run.
* The `grafana` playbook still needs to be converted to using roles.
* Improve/document some variables like `WF_RESTRICTED_NETWORK`.
