A new release can be created by one of the main DOMjudge developers.
The following steps should be taken (local directories refer to those
on the account `domjudge@vm-domjudge`):

 1. Test everything. (duh...)
 1. Commit the correct version number in the `ChangeLog` and `README` files,
    set `DEBUG=0` in `etc/common-config.php` (if releasing from the `master`
    branch).
 1. Create a release version `$TAG` in Git with `$TAG` the version number
    x.y.z:
        git tag -s -m "Tag release version $TAG." $TAG
    See `git tag --help` for more details on how to tag with(out) a
    GPG signature.
 1. Create the release tarball by running
        make_release.sh $TAG
    Optionally add a git-repo-url as second parameter (defaults to
    `https://github.com/DOMjudge/domjudge.git`) to point it to your local
    repository, before committing to the central repository.

    The tarball is placed in the current dir; check that it looks correct,
    test e.g. by unpacking it and running
        ./configure && make build
 1. If releasing from the master branch, create a new version branch:
        git checkout -b x.y
        git push --set-upstream origin x.y
        git checkout master
 1. Update files above to `{version+1}DEV`, `DEBUG=1`, and commit.
 1. Copy domjudge-$TAG.tar.gz* to `/srv/http/domjudge/releases/`
 1. Update the DOMjudge homepage: commit changes in the `domjudge-scripts`
    repository under `website/` and run `make install` as domjudge@domjudge
 1. If this is a new major or minor version, update the release documentation
    under `/srv/http/domjudge/docs/manual` by adding a new version to the
    file `versions.json` and updating the redirect destination in `index.html`.
    The documentation is regenerated once every hour.
 1. Bump the docker containers and build Debian packages (or make someone
    do this).
 1. Send an email to domjudge-announce@domjudge.org.
 1. Don't forget to push everything to the central Git repository
    (especially the release tags, since these are not pushed by default),
    e.g. with
        git push origin ${TAG%.?} refs/tags/$TAG
