A new release can be created by one of the main DOMjudge developers.
The following steps should be taken (local directories refer to those
on the account `domjudge@vm-domjudge`):

 1. Test everything. (duh...)
 1. Commit the correct version number in the `ChangeLog` and `README` files,
    set `DEBUG=0` in `etc/common-config.php` (if releasing from the `master`
    branch).
 1. Create a release version `$TAG` in Git with `$TAG` the version number
    x.y.z:
        git tag [-a|-s|-u <GPG-key-ID>] -m "Tag release version $TAG." $TAG
    See `git tag --help` for more details on how to tag with(out) a
    GPG signature.
 1. Create the release tarball by running
        make_release.sh $TAG [<git-repo-url>]
    The `<git-repo-url>` defaults to `https://github.com/DOMjudge/domjudge.git`
    but can be pointed to your local repository, before committing to the
    central repository.

    The tarball is placed in the current dir; check that it looks correct,
    test e.g. by unpacking it and running
        ./configure && make build
 1. Update files above to `{version+1}DEV`, `DEBUG=1`, and commit.
 1. Generate sha256sum and GPG signature:
        sha256sum domjudge-$TAG.tar.gz > domjudge-$TAG.tar.gz.sha256sum
        gpg -a --detach-sign --digest-algo SHA256 domjudge-$TAG.tar.gz
    Copy these files to `/srv/http/domjudge/releases/`
 1. Update the DOMjudge homepage: commit changes in the `domjudge-scripts`
    repository under `website/` and run "make install" as domjudge@domjudge
 1. Update the release documentation under `/srv/http/domjudge/docs/`
    (if releasing the latest stable branch).
 1. If necessary, add a source package of included dash static shell in
    `/srv/http/domjudge/sources/`.
 1. Send an email to domjudge-announce@domjudge.org.
 1. Don't forget to push everything to the central Git repository
    (especially the release tags, since these are not pushed by default),
    e.g. with
        git push origin <x.y> refs/tags/<x.y.z>
